## 💖 Love Question Card | Single Page Fun App

A playful, interactive **single-page love question card** built for fun and emotions ❤️  
This browser-based experience asks a simple question — *“Do you love me?”* — with a smart twist: the **No** button refuses to be clicked 😄

Designed with smooth animations, mobile-friendly interactions, and a celebratory confetti effect on success.
